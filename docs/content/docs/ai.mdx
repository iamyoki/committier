## Usage

```sh
pnpm committier ai
```

Optionally add a script in `package.json`, to map a shorter command for commit CLI

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "commit": "committier commit",
    "commit:ai": "committier ai"
  }
}
```

Then

```sh
pnpm commit:ai
```

## About Model

The first run will automatically install a lightweight model of approximately 800MB and cache it globally to avoid redundant installations.

> The cache dir is `~/.committier/models`

|Model|Size|CPU|GPU
|-|-|-|-|
|Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct|862.1MB|✅|✅|
